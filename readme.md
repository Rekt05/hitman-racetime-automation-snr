This app takes a racetime.gg link and automatically adds the player streams to an obs layout specifically made for hitman SN Races

The OBS Scene Collection this entire app was based on was made by the awesome [ThatObserver](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY6kHCCKxcVRcMVf9PBtz6w)

[Linux install video](https://youtu.be/cg9OBavoEqw) - slightly outdated in terms of presets/link pasting and other small details, refer to basically all the text below for a more comprehensive overview

Windows video coming eventually when linux is confirmed to be working

Currently this comes with 2 JSON file presets:
- SN_Race_Preset_1.json is the basically unmodified version with the original stream layout
- SN_Race_Preset_2.json is a version that i slightly changed to make the stream sizes a bit bigger

You can go through the import process with any combination of presets of your choosing and the app will work for the scene collection you are currently using.
If you have a preset you would like to add refer to the very bottom of the readme

Usage Instructions/Notes:
- Import the scene to obs with Scene Collection -> Import -> Browse -> SN_Race_Preset_x.json in the SNAUTOOBS folder, use the same folder when it asks you to locate the missing images.
- For the OBS password go to Tools -> WebSocket Server Settings -> Show Connect Info -> Server Password. Make sure that Enable WebSocket server under Tools -> WebSocket Server Settings is also enabled. 
- Paste in the racetime link or click the "Find Current Race" button.
- Show Placement Images when ticked will automatically show the placement image related to them when they finish.
- Use the arrow buttons to move the players up/down the list and use the trash can button to remove them from the list, you can add them back using the + button in the Removed Players section.
- Ensure that your mic and any other applicable audio sources are configured properly.
- Double click in the .ttf font and click install, restart your pc/obs for the font to apply.
- All placement images have a luma key filter called Toggle_Hook with Luma Max + Min at 1.0 and the smooth for both at 0, this is for the auto placement images toggle functionality.
- You can freely move and resize things like "Steamer Name X" and the stream itself and the program will still work as intended, to move the names click on the source in the appropriate folder, to move/resize the stream just click on it in the preview.
- If you want to move the name to be on top of the video player, remember to drag it above the stream source in the folder.

Future features i have thought of (and will probably do):
- Spotlight one player for the Stream (Zoom) Scene.
- Automate the Leaderboard

if you have any ideas for features or if you have a preset you would like to add open a *pr or dm me on discord @Rekt05

*for Preset PR's you can make sure to find and replace you computer name from the file path to potentially avoid leaking personal information.
